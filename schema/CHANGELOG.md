# Schema changelog

The files in `schema/` are versioned compatibility contracts. Any change to a
published schema bumps the version and adds a migration note here.

Versioning: the `schema_version` field carries plain semver. A **major** bump
means consumers must reject documents they do not understand; a **minor** bump
adds optional fields; a **patch** bump is documentation or constraint
clarification that does not change which documents validate.

## control-artifact/v1 — 1.0.0 (unreleased, Phase 0)

Initial definition per DESIGN.md §8. No migration.

Notes on choices that constrain future changes:

- `enforcement` is always an **array**, never a bare string. DESIGN.md §8 notes a
  control may be both SCP-enforced and Config-monitored; encoding that as a
  scalar-or-array union would make canonicalization ambiguous, so the array form
  is the only form.
- `artifact.sources[]` requires `sha256` on every entry and uses `oneOf` over
  `catalog` / `mapping` / `artifact` so a union artifact's provenance is
  structurally distinguishable from a compile from upstream sources.
- `config_rule_parameter.order` is **required**. Union resolves overlapping
  parameters by this declared order; a missing order is a hard error at compile
  time (DESIGN.md §9), so it must not be omissible in the artifact.
- `scp_statement.exempt_automation_role` is a boolean marker rather than a
  literal ARN, because the in-account automation role ARN is not known until
  vend time. The SCP packer materializes the condition.
- `compiled_at` and all timestamps are constrained to second-precision UTC with
  a `Z` suffix. Sub-second or offset forms would break deterministic hashing.

## profile/v1 — 1.0.0 (unreleased, Phase 0)

Initial definition per DESIGN.md §7 and §13. No migration.

- `account.tags` forbids keys matching `^automat:` — automat's conventional tags
  (DESIGN.md §14) are applied by the tool and must not be overridable by a
  profile, since they are what `list` and `verify` key off.
- `placement.ou_path` is capped at five entries, mirroring the OU nesting limit
  (DESIGN.md §3, fact 10).

## evidence-manifest/v1 — 1.0.0 (unreleased, Phase 0)

Initial definition per DESIGN.md §11. No migration.

- `records[]` is append-only and hash-chained: `previous_sha256` of the first
  record is 64 zeros. `record_sha256` covers the canonicalized record with
  `record_sha256` and `signature` themselves omitted, so a record can be signed
  after it is hashed without invalidating the chain.
- `signature` is optional at the schema level so an unsigned local manifest is
  still a valid document; whether signatures are required is a policy decision
  above the schema.
- `error.remediation` exists because permission failures must state which action,
  which resource, and what grant would fix it (CLAUDE.md rule 7) — that text is
  part of the evidence record, not just log output.
